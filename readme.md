## MiniMax Algorithm
Tooks 8.48 seconds to make move on first turn for MiniMax algorithm.
 
Tooks 0.28 seconds to make move on first turn for MiniMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
 
## Q-Learning Agent
I have trained both agents between each other for 500.000 times. After that I have tested them against Alpha-Beta Pruning and all games have ended as tie.
